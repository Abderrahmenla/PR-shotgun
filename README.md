# PR-shotgun
this package is built for fun, if you want to boost your chance of having a good internship and add in your CV "open-source contributor" then you're in the right place.
PR-shotgun parse the package that you're willing to contribute and extract all comments in it, then send the comments to automation.py to find typos in the comments and correct it (thanks to selenium who made it possible) then you can verify the corrected comments one by one and send a PR. and voila you're an open-source contributor
